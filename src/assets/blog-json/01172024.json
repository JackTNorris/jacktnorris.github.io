Now, I'm in the middle of rural Paraguay, fresh off a bout of food poisoning and nursing a broken foot.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img height=\"300\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczM9mS6BYDigkDigBa4sel9ltoxwAn40wHTHYG-dMMB2ZJLK5r638imux31vZnVHRbG2A7kUPNB9ZIAjgNSQQOKsaxe-yPOPJlnES4l9xMOUgK6_Y92gneaxx34b-1WH1aK-JM0nC1hHTOmPaSoOCdF_sw=w1498-h1998-s-no-gm?authuser=0\" />\n\n  <figcaption align=\"center\"><em>Celebrating graduation on two non-broken feet</em></figcaption>\n</p>\n\nA few weeks after graduation, I traded my cap in gown in for the \"hardest job you'll ever love\" as a Peace Corps Volunteer. While some might say my altruism has gotten the best of me, one thing is for certain:  I'm still a computer scientist / software engineer at heart. As such, I've elected to try and document some of my journey in the Peace Corps through this blog that I made from scratch (hence why things sometimes looks like crap, so forgive the design and spelling mistakes). With it, I hope to show my parents (and the world) I'm still alive, stave off occasional hours of bordem, and keep my coding skils from atrophying.\n\nAnyways, back to the broken foot thing. It all started when Grace and I arrived as Peace Corps (PC) Health Volunteers in Paraguay. We arrived in-country around May 29th after a short stint of training in Washington D.C. At the airport in Asuncion, we were immediately greeted by some awesome PC staff and whisked to a nearby hotel. Looking out the fogged-up windows of the PC van, let's just say I could tell we weren't in (Ar)kansas anymore.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img height=\"300\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczOUYesIEC3xbCgwqTwzvX5kZ8ud_N9bHJjzXuC4M-9w0eqSgIsZL39YENjB0W43mkTSAQqn6ov0Zcn2tN8Dp5lqhOxTo7YaJ7H1K-OAPoR7TEnP_HKyiXZ0dbCGzXs2RGZQs6_szCY1PHea6TcJrbwP_g=w2664-h1998-s-no-gm?authuser=0\" />\n\n  <figcaption align=\"center\"><em>We ain't in Ar(kansas) no more Toto</em></figcaption>\n</p>\n\nWe spent a few days in the hotel \"easing in\" to Paraguayan culture and getting briefed on a variety of PC protocols and expectations. Off hours were filled with card games, goofy photos, chess, or mini adventures outside of the hotel to get a \"lay of the land\". Surprisingly, despite coming from many walks of life and parts of the U.S., all the volunteers hit it off really well!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img height=\"300\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczOJ9HkKs1RsZ832rzG85QrFgbSe6VUk0CcU8DRGeoU9wICGgoqcWVsNamo470ApqQ6TRtycjjU5RICJXarFHZHxMYWJ3I665hACgj9dlOuU_MpLClGv-3ffUFAN0-PC8pFdCOknCvoxDOmBSY7luaAGDA=w1498-h1998-s-no-gm?authuser=0\" />\n\n  <figcaption align=\"center\"><em>One of said goofy photos</em></figcaption>\n</p>\n\nAfter a few days of getting briefed in the hotel, volunteers were quickly matched with and shipped off to host families. Fortunately, Grace and I hit it off with our host parents almost immediately (not to brag, but probably on account of the insaaaaane magic card trick I showed them when we first met). Over the course of the next month, we spent evenings watching movies (or possum fights), playing othello, making alfajores / chipa, chowing down on mandioca (the starch staple of Paraguay), or laughing as Ciri (our host dad) taught me funny Guarani phrases like <em>chivivi</em>. Life as a volunteer was pretty solid -- that is, until tragedy (or rather, a mango) struck.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n      <img height=\"300\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczPJZINTchRA3NsFHHq76iCHlSHFTYU-p5vXESM9nRrwVWyOELo6Ohh_GOwkTHzKffqvoD8pHusmZnut6RYDbma4fYVo2rmV0mAoHQ7JJs_KKZ5LHWlgi1fOsYxuf3QNq0170ouHYmqrMwtPO_zmo3iW_w=w2664-h1998-s-no-gm?authuser=0\" />\n      <img height=\"300\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczOg3OZXsdrVKubcCxP_S05vJO39EljSfrH7syr6HcsCvNBQ3eX4bppdJz-fTmkE5ahI9l_hQ71Cos3BRug0Xu7XaMWIzipJmeB5aQhRW7Qikatqxk6GW1kPMqZp1BLRQPwKFgXSo9MhAdak8TXccZLj-w=w2664-h1998-s-no-gm?authuser=0\" />\n\n  <figcaption align=\"center\"><em>Enjoying life playing othello & tinkering, P.M.

If I chose to go home, given PC's 40-day recovery policy, it was unlikely I would be able to return. I'd be lying if I said this wasn't a nailbiting decision, but then I realized I'm living in a country with pro soccer players. Armed with that knowledge, I went ahead and opted to have my surgery in Paraguay. With that decision, just a week after breaking my foot, I was under the knife.

Now, <em>I, Robot, Her,</em> and <em>Terminator</em> seem like more than just lovable sci-fi classics -- they seem like plausible near futures.\n\nA key component of many of the AI models we see today are <em>neural-networks</em>: computer systems modeled (roughly) on the human brain that allow computers to \"learn\". As someone interested in researching AI and its applications, I've always wanted to deep-dive into the specifics of how these networks work.\n\nNow, I know how they work at high level (feed forward step, backpropogation step, need for MLP for XOR problem, activation functions to introduce non-linearity, CNNs for translation independence, e.t.c.) and can even train my own models. However, I've always felt that I don't really know something until I've built it or spent hours playing around with it. \n\nAs such, <em>I've set out to build a neural network from the ground up, using minimal libraries, in C++</em>. I already kinda tried to do this a few months back using 3B1B's video as a guide, but things didn't go that well...let's just say it's not a good idea to build all the functions for your neural network before testing any of them.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img height=\"400\" width=\"400\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/4nfVvbg.gif\" />\n  <figcaption align=\"center\">Me when my model got worse after training</figcaption>\n</p>\n\nAnyways, I'm gonna go ahead and build this sucker incrementally and write about it so I can 1) force myself to test things as I go along and 2) give myself the opportunity to exercise the \"Feynman technique\". Let's get started.\n\n<h2>I. Linear Regression with 1-D Inputs & Outputs</h2>\n\nI'll be starting off by building a simple linear regression model. A throwback to elementary school, linear models are of the form:\n\n$$\nf(x) = wx + b\n$$\n\n<em>Linear regression</em> involves finding a <em>linear</em> function that accurately maps inputs to outputs (ex: apartment square feet ($x$) and rent ($y$)). In layman's terms, it's the process of finding the \"best fit line\" for some data points in the form ($x$, $y$). In this case, we're tweaking $w$ and $b$ to make $f(x)$ spit out a value close to $y$ for a given $x$. There are more complex forms of linear regression we'll get into later, but we're gonna start with this. To build this linear regression model, I'll:\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Create some data to test the model with (simple linear line)</li>\n  <li>Write a \"loss function\" that allows me to quantify the effectiveness of the current model in fitting said data</li>\n  <li>Write a \"train\" method which gradually adjusts the parameters of the linear function to make it more accurate</li>\n</ol>\n\nCreating the data is pretty straightforward. I know the linear function I'm wanting my model to \"find\" is gonna be $y = 3x + 1$, so I just created ordered pairs that follow this function:\n\n```js\n///*main.cpp*///\n\nint main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {\n    vector<double> x;\n    vector<double> y;\n\n    // Fill x with values from 0 to 5\n    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {\n        x.push_back(i);\n    }\n\n    // Fill y with a roughly linear relationship to x (y = 3x + 1)\n    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {\n        y.push_back(3 * x[i] + 1);\n    }\n}\n```\n<figcaption align=\"center\">Generating Our Data</figcaption>\n\nNow things get a little more dicey. Priming things for the future, I went ahead and set up a NeuralNet class (yay OOP). In it, I've got the function signature for a constructor (to set the learning rate for our model), our loss function (MSE), and the a train function (to find optimum values of $w$ and $b$).\n\n```js\n///*NeuralNet.h*///\n\nclass NeuralNet {\n    public:\n        NeuralNet(double learningRate);\n        static double MSE(vector<double> &experimental, vector<double> &expected);\n        void train(vector<double> input, vector<double> actualOutput, int epochs);\n\n    private:\n        double learningRate;\n};\n```\n\nWe'll be using <em>mean squared error</em> as our <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function\">loss function</a></strong>, which helps quantify the accuracy of our current model. The formula for this is as follows:\n$$\nMSE =\n\\frac{1}{n}\n\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(f(x_i) - y_i)^2\n$$\n<figcaption align=\"center\">Mean Squared Error Function</figcaption>\n\nIn this case, $n$ represents the number of items in our training data set, and $x_i$ and $y_i$ represent a single input-output pair. Indicated by the word \"error\" in the name here, we want the value of our loss function to be low! \n\nMSE finds the average amount by which my function $f(x)$ is \"off\" at predicting a $y$ value given a particular $x$ value. We square the difference between $f$ and $y$ to 1) allow our average to work as expected with negative numbers and 2) keep our cost function as a differentiable function, which will come in handy later. Here's the function definition for this:\n\n```js\ndouble NeuralNet::MSE(vector<double> &calculated, vector<double> &truthy)\n{\n    double sum = 0;\n    for (size_t i = 0; i < calculated.size(); ++i)\n    {\n        sum += pow(calculated[i] - truthy[i], 2);\n    }\n    return sum / (double)calculated.size();\n}\n```\n\nNow comes the training function. With this, I'm trying to find the $w$ and $b$ values which minimize the MSE cost function above. Rewriting the MSE function with $w$ and $b$ in it (and replacing MSE with $J$ for notational simplicity), we have the following function:\n\n$$\nMSE = J(w, b) =\n\\frac{1}{n}\n\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(wx_i+b - y_i)^2\n$$\n\nNow, at this point, things might feel a bit like alphabet soup with all the formulas, so let's try and visualize what's going on here. Given a fixed set of training points ($(x, y)$ pairs), if we graph $J(w, b)$, $w$ and $b$ in a 3-D plane, we get the following <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/JackTNorris/89c02f43f61b52b27e7843fcad061218\">soup-bowl looking graph</a>: \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczN9Jg1wyVOVfLbZjkd1JrEXu4-u-jEEX0jv15zoDUVcedMne38A7MUTDZ2ZUv_CAJetEpRPDUVbd3GpYe6W1V5UY0btzKsHQ9AFHl-0P-QQ0g501s0Au5mwpocnzXk1vThSUyZ2Hur504_eLjgWWUjJbw=w640-h480-s-no-gm?authuser=0\" />\n</p>\n<figcaption align=\"center\">Graph of Our Loss Function</figcaption>\n\nWith our train function, we want to select a $w$ and a $b$ that minimizes our cost function $J$. We can see where this is graphically (at the bottom of our \"soup bowl\"), but how do we get there programatically? If we've selected a $w$ and $b$, how do we know how to tweak them in order to minimize our cost function? The answer (in this case) is an optimization method called <strong><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/topics/gradient-descent\">gradient descent</a></strong>.\n\nFor starters, we've got to calculate the partial derivatives of $J$ with respect to $w$ and $b$, $\\frac{\\partial{J}}{\\partial{w}}$ and $\\frac{\\partial{J}}{\\partial{b}}$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial{J}}{\\partial{w}} = \\frac{2}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n(wx_i+b - y_i)x_i\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial{J}}{\\partial{b}} = \\frac{2}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n(wx_i+b - y_i)\n$$\n\nBy doing this, we've effectively calculated the <em>gradient</em> of the function $J(w,b)$:\n\n$$\n\\nabla{\nJ(w, b) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial{J}}{\\partial{w}} \\ \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial{J}}{\\partial{b}}\n\\end{bmatrix} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{2}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n(wx_i+b - y_i)x_i \\ \\\\\n\\frac{2}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n(wx_i+b - y_i)\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\n}\n$$\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with the idea of a gradient -- don't worry. The main thing to know here is that this gradient tells us the the rate of change of $J$ with respect to its independent variables at a given point. If you plot this gradient as a vector at said point, it points in the direction of steepest ascent, with the magnitude of this vector growing as the ascent grows steeper. \n\nGiven that our gradient vector indicates the direction of <em>steepest</em> ascent, we want to \"nudge\" our weights & biases in the opposite direction of the gradient. From this, we have the following formula, in which $\\alpha$ represents our <strong>learning rate</strong>:\n\n$$\nw_{new} = w_{old} - \\alpha\\frac{\\partial{J}}{\\partial{w}}\n$$\n$$\nb_{new} = b_{old} - \\alpha\\frac{\\partial{J}}{\\partial{b}}\n$$\n\nThe \"learning rate\" dictates the rate at which we find the optimal values of $w$ and $b$. I'll commentate on this a bit more in the future, but the thing to know with it for now is that you don't want it to be too big (or else $J$ will never converge to its lowest value, \"ping-ponging\" between solutions that are too high and too low) or too small (or else $J$ will take forever to converge on its lowest value).\n\nWith our train function, we'll iteratively adjust our weight and bias using the formula above. An <strong>epoch</strong>, as mentioned in the function below, represents a single one of these iterations. The code for this train function is listed below:\n\n```js\n/* NeuralNet.cpp */\nvoid NeuralNet::train(vector<double> inputs, vector<double> expectedOutputs, int epochs)\n{\n    srand(time(NULL));\n    double weight = random() % 40;\n    double bias = random() % 40;\n    for(int epoch = 0; epoch < epochs; epoch++)\n    {\n        vector<double> my_calc;\n        double temp_weight_update = 0;\n        double temp_bias_update = 0;\n        for(int input = 0; input < inputs.size(); input++)\n        {\n            double f = weight * inputs[input] + bias;\n            my_calc.push_back(f);\n            temp_weight_update += 2*(f - expectedOutputs[input])*inputs[input];\n            temp_bias_update += 2*(f - expectedOutputs[input]);\n        }\n        weight -= learningRate * temp_weight_update / inputs.size();\n        bias -= learningRate * temp_bias_update / inputs.size();\n        cout << \"New weight: \" << weight << endl;\n        cout << \"New bias: \" << bias << endl;\n        cout << \"Loss: \" << MSE(my_calc, expectedOutputs) << endl << endl;\n    }\n}\n```\n<figcaption align=\"center\">Train Function</figcaption>\n\nNow, it's time to test it! We're looking for our loss function to continue to decrease and for our weight and bias converge on 3 and 1 respectively:\n\n```js\nNew weight: 10\nNew bias: 1.5\nLoss: 2825\n\nNew weight: 5.7\nNew bias: 0.05\nLoss: 308.25\n\nNew weight: 4.27\nNew bias: -0.395\nLoss: 34.3825\n.\n.\n.\n\nNew weight: 3.06295\nNew bias: 0.820536\nLoss: 0.011469\n```\nLooks to be working (more or less)! \n\n<h2>II. Linear Regression with Multi-dimensional Inputs and Outputs</h2>\n\nNow we can adjust our model to be able to handle multi-dimensional inputs and outputs. Concretely, this might look like mapping square footage ($x_1$), average income of the zipcode ($x_2$), and city population ($x_3$) to the rent ($y_1$) and average monthly utility bill ($y_2$) for an apartment. \n\nGiven we'll be dealing with vectors, we'll go ahead and invoke the help of the <em><a href=\"http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page\">Eigen</a></em> library, which contains optimized implementations of vector and matrix objects and operations in C++. Hopefully, this is the only library we'll need to use for a while!\n\nFortunately, even when we move into higher dimensional spaces, our formulas <em>almost</em> stay the same. However, I will confess that they do get a little more convoluted. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img height=\"400\" width=\"400\" src=\"https://media.tenor.com/8uZKpgaGe9EAAAAM/hold-onto-your-buts-butt.gif\" />\n</p>\n\nGiven that our weight is now a matrix, $\\bold{W}$ (and not a single value), we now have to take the partial derivative with respect to $J$ for every element in $\\bold{W}$. Our bias is now also a vector, $\\overrightarrow{b}$. With these change, we now have this as the definition of our linear function:\n\n$$\nf(\\overrightarrow{x}) = \\bold{W}\\overrightarrow{x} + \\overrightarrow{b} \n$$\n\nOur cost function also changes a little bit -- we're no longer dealing with 1-D outputs, so our cost function has to reflect that:\n\n$$\nMSE =\n\\frac{1}{nm}\n\\displaystyle\n\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{j=1}^m(f_j(x^i) - y^i_j)^2\n$$\nHere, $m$ represents the number of elements in the output vector, and $f_j$ and $y_j$ represent the $j$ components of each respective vector (forgive me if the notation isn't exactly \"formal\" here). If you think I'm going overboard with summation symbols, get ready for one more as I rewrite MSE in terms of $\\bold{W}$ and $\\overrightarrow{b}$:\n$$\nMSE = J(\\bold{W}, \\overrightarrow{b}) =\n\\frac{1}{nm}\n\\displaystyle\n\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{j=1}^m((\\sum_{k=1}^t\\bold{W}^T_{kj}x^i_k) + b_j - y^i_j)^2\n$$\n\nHere, $t$ represents the dimensionality of the input vector ($\\overrightarrow{x}$), and $x_k$ represents a component of $\\overrightarrow{x}$. $\\bold{W}$ has to be transposed in order to allow multiplication between it and the input vector $\\overrightarrow{x}$.\n\nNow, just like before, we need the partial derivative of $J$ with respect to each element in $\\bold{W}$ and each element in $\\overrightarrow{b}$. Things get a little wonky because of the transpose, but just know that although we're calculating the derivative with respect to the transpose for now, we can always \"transpose the transpose\" and get our original $\\bold{W}$ back.:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial{J}}{\\partial{\\bold{W^T_{aj}}}} = \n\\frac{2}{nm}\n\\sum_{i=1}^n((\\sum_{k=1}^t\\bold{W}^T_{kj}x^i_k) + b_j - yx^i_j)x_a\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial{J}}{\\partial{b_j}} = \n\\frac{2}{nm}\n\\sum_{i=1}^n((\\sum_{k=1}^t\\bold{W}^T_{kj}xx^i_k) + b_j - yx^i_j)\n$$\n\nThese partial derivatives aren't quite as trivial as the last two, so feel free to bring out the paper and pencil if you're following along. Sadly, given that we've moved into multi-dimensional space, visualizing what is going on here is a little tough, so I can only leave you with the source code for our new MSE function and our new train function.\n\n```js\n//* NeuralNet.cpp *//\n\ndouble NeuralNet::MSE_MULTIDIMENSIONAL(vector<Eigen::VectorXd> &experimental, vector<Eigen::VectorXd> &expected)\n{\n    double sum = 0;\n    for(int i = 0; i < experimental.size(); i++)\n    {  \n        for(int j = 0; j < experimental[i].size(); j++)\n        {\n            // fix this\n            sum += (experimental[i](j) - expected[i](j)) * (experimental[i](j) - expected[i](j)) ;\n        }\n    }\n    return sum / (double)experimental.size();\n    \n}\n\nvoid NeuralNet::eigenTrain(vector<Eigen::VectorXd> &inputs, vector<Eigen::VectorXd> &expected_outputs, int epochs) {\n    if (inputs.size() != expected_outputs.size())\n    {\n        throw runtime_error(\"must have same number of inputs as outputs\");\n    }\n    if (inputs.size() == 0 || expected_outputs.size() == 0)\n    {\n        throw runtime_error(\"must use non-empty inputs and outputs\");\n    }\n    int input_dim = inputs[0].size();\n    int output_dim = expected_outputs[0].size();\n    Eigen::MatrixXd weights = Eigen::MatrixXd::Random(input_dim, output_dim);\n    Eigen::VectorXd biases = Eigen::VectorXd::Random(output_dim);\n    for(int epoch = 0; epoch < epochs; epoch++)\n    {\n        Eigen::MatrixXd temp_weight_updates = Eigen::MatrixXd::Zero(input_dim, output_dim);\n        Eigen::VectorXd temp_bias_updates = Eigen::VectorXd::Zero(output_dim);\n\n        vector<Eigen::VectorXd> error_helper;\n        for(int input = 0; input < inputs.size(); input++)\n        {\n            Eigen::VectorXd network_output = weights.transpose() * inputs[input] + biases;\n            error_helper.push_back(network_output);\n            // part of MSE:\n            for(int j = 0; j < network_output.size(); j++)\n            {\n                for(int k = 0; k < weights.rows(); k++)\n                {\n                    temp_weight_updates(k, j) += 2 * (network_output(j) - expected_outputs[input](j)) * inputs[input](k);\n                }\n                temp_bias_updates(j) += 2 * (network_output(j) - expected_outputs[input](j));\n            }\n        }\n\n        //update step\n        weights -= learningRate * temp_weight_updates / (inputs.size() * output_dim);\n        biases -= learningRate * temp_bias_updates / (inputs.size() * output_dim);\n        cout << \"New weight: \" << endl << weights << endl;\n        cout << \"New bias: \" << endl << biases << endl;\n        cout << \"Loss: \" << MSE_MULTIDIMENSIONAL(error_helper, expected_outputs) << endl << endl;\n    }\n}\n```\n<figcaption align=\"center\">Updated Multi-dimensional MSE and Train Function</figcaption>\n\nWe'll need some new multi-dimensional test data to go along with our new multi-dimensional linear regression model. Take note of what our expected weight matrix and bias are here:\n\n```js\n/* main.cpp */\n\nint main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {\n\n    // Initialize variables as 2D vectors with 100 rows and 1 column\n    vector<Eigen::VectorXd> x;\n    vector<Eigen::VectorXd> y;\n\n    // Fill x with values from 0 to 5\n    for (int i = 0; i < 50; ++i) {\n        Eigen::VectorXd g = Eigen::VectorXd::Random(3);\n        x.push_back(g);\n    }\n\n    Eigen::MatrixXd w_sol(3, 2);\n    w_sol << 1, 2,\n             3, 4,\n             5, 6;\n    \n    Eigen::VectorXd b_sol(2);\n    b_sol << 4, 6;\n\n    // Fill y with a linear functions\n    for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {\n        y.push_back(w_sol.transpose() * x[i] + b_sol);\n    }\n\n    NeuralNet nn(stof(argv[2])); // learning rate\n    //nn.addLayer(1, nn.none);\n    nn.eigenTrain(x, y, stoi(argv[1])); // epochs\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\nLast but not least, least go ahead and test things with a learning rate of 0.005 and 10000 epochs: \n```js\n...\nNew weight: \n0.999986  1.99998\n 2.99999  3.99998\n       5        6\nNew bias: \n4\n6\nLoss: 2.66554e-10\n```\n\n<em>\\*chef's kiss\\*</em> \n\nSweet! It works. Now we've got a machine learning model which can find the optimum linear function between a set of (possibly) independent and (possibly) dependent variables. I know it ain't much, but we'll expand this in the future, ideally having a model which can accurately classify items in the MNIST dataset when we're fully done. For now, thanks for reading, and stay tuned for logistic regression! \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"400\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://media.tenor.com/SuADVxKkQ-AAAAAM/frankenstein-its-alive.gif\" />\n</p>","createdOn":1727132719303,"lastEdited":1728522818995,"tag":"üíª computer science","title":"Building a Neural Network from \"Scratch\" Part 1: Simple Linear Regression"},"-O9UwhBY1xxjixv_4N9B":{"content":"<em>\\*note: The content of this website is mine\nalone and does not reflect the views of the U.S. Government, the Peace Corps, or\nthe Paraguayan Government.\\*</em>\n\nGrace and I have been in site for a little over two month now, and we just had our site presentations! The school district superintendents came in clutch and let us use their projector, and the screen that a professor at the colegio set up for us looked fantastic.

Now, I'm actually able to play sports, even if that just means hobbling around as the goalie in f√∫tbol or jumping an inch off the ground during volleyball. Things haven't been all play and no work though -- Grace and I have also been able to help facilitate a couple <em>charlas</em> with a psychologist and the health agents in our community.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"300\" alt=\"electronics project\" height=\"300\"src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczOanpgZSVEKlv3Hd2wyFeL8TCGZWDwN0IsQ8W97-U9WKrFY7c-5d3_lG7zaP-XX1u2m2FvkJ5StIJXJX3SUh7dbN218KIupVAfoqvQB8dTnfuRcmQyKl7uumy7reWLPfU_CoaUj7dkrPApJidYf34Hx0Q=w960-h720-s-no-gm?authuser=0\" />\n<figcaption align=\"center\"><em>Me fumbling through our first</em> charla <em>in Spanish</em></figcaption>\n</p>\n\nPractically everyone we've come into contact with has been super guapo, from the directoras of colegios/escuelas to attendants of nearby shops. Grace and I got bikes a few weeks back, so it has been awesome to ride around and visit places and people we haven't seen before. It's also nice to have a quicker route to the houses that sell ice cream and empanadas üòã. \n\nOur host family has been especially great! We've been to a baptism, a liqueur festival, a family reunion, and a few birthday parties already, so we definitely feel like we're \"part of the family\"! Our host sister is a lawyer and our host brother is a bacteriologist, so dinner conversations are always pretty interesting (at least as interesting as they can get with my weak Spanish vocabulary). Grace and I have also had a blast playing cards, chess, Jenga, and Othello with our host niece. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"300\" alt=\"electronics project\" height=\"300\"src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczMZega5FtG1COOUEGQ0oY-aqd21iKjxUHF1Awzy3gA-Y7eUw55D8OY2cn0o3EJCchr3tM2TPKSQTBl4URd0tql1fetQ9Xp8Agzc_C2ZXRNMMyTPGvjq51rJY_JssWOcHqBuNiLfoeHObzY1NW8dhwbIQA=w868-h799-s-no-gm?authuser=0\" />\n<figcaption align=\"center\"><em>Our host bro's birthday gift!</em></figcaption>\n</p>\n\n\nCuisine here has definitely been a bit more \"adventurous\" then what I'm used to in the U.S though. Liver and tripe have been on the menu a few times, and on one occasion, we had an <em>asado</em> with <em>cabeza de chancho</em> (pig head). Most of the chancho was pretty delicious, but I think I'll pass on the brain next time. Grace says I'm just being \"picky\", but I don't know -- I think I just prefer flavors that are a little less... intelligent üß†. I'm still the guy to \"try anything once\", but after this experience, vegetarianism is looking quite enticing!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"our first brush with mondongo\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczNNqEkHnKKo8c_T5sSaDWAHa9w1gqprFx2OtJZiFJZW_X3xa_mtB9ctbbHQUMfDTUxQqOB_tCyPNAEJzgul2CAxfRF3wFHac9CmOXMkn2yMXxuruKbgbJe6OrO1gCjpXMPGyzvzIqRrQgQX6wrcMaB4mg=w2152-h1995-s-no-gm?authuser=0\" />\n</p>\n  <figcaption align=\"center\"><em>Our first brush with </em>  mondongo <em>(cow stomach)</em></figcaption>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"cabeza de chancho\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczNQlhntPQO4mkOdXtP7TwLCdf8zkLecE6xYByYAvcfjQsFq-SVp0xJUP3LQQ4YQEngvxcDM9m5mZprYNwnmEfHtHPSKO8JSPABb58FJzZtjfHE6aVS50iFS7h6O4hYB_a9TUqFIUsenwaSB4xx9-hewZw=w2926-h1995-s-no-gm?authuser=0\" />\n    <figcaption align=\"center\"><em>Mindblowing dinner</em></figcaption>\n</p>\n\nIn other news, Grace and I finally found a house to rent! There were a few hoops we had to jump through to get things finalized for it, but it looks like we'll have our own spot for the duration of our service. A huge plus is the plants we have behind the house -- we've got a mango tree, an avocado tree, and lime tree! Looks like we're gonna have a pretty awesome Christmas when these bad boys ripen.\n\nWe just moved in, which isn't saying much considering 1) we don't own that much stuff and 2) we only moved two doors down from our host family. Regardless, Grace and I are excited to be in our own space to make non-instant coffee and have more control over our schedules. Grace is going to have to have a stricter routine now that she's a pro soccer player.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczPfMPCgiI2wswgs-T9cpRH7zqq7apY3ZLy-ZFXK4up1MTGLjnBeV1j7hdhZTrFIlM9t5OIXnqJZqShDof8jpPcqh4tes-MV3zzsNnDXScSqvkAh_gSj2XcfVs_9r40EC7866ug7zLTFVleIJFD7aLS_Vw=w1141-h1045-s-no-gm?authuser=0\" />\n  <figcaption align=\"center\"><em>Shooting my shot with a pro</em> futbolista</figcaption>\n</p>\n\nThat's all for now.

We have running water, a slow internet connection, and A/C, so we definitely fall on the \"Posh Corps\" side of the site spectrum (bless the souls of the volunteers that grapple with \"compost toilets\" üôè). Afternoons are long and hot, but a cold <em>guampa</em> of <em>terer√©</em> with a friend makes time fly by.\n\nAlthough we don't live with our host family anymore, we still see them pretty often. Whether we're passing by on the way to our USF, buying groceries, or sharing a Sunday <em>asado</em>, we've had no shortage of opportunities to interact with them, and it's always a treat.

She loves attacking our feet and peeing in our bathroom (ironically right next to the toilet), so she has been a bit of a handful. We love her nonetheless! To keep an eye on her when we leave the house, I went ahead and made a super rudimentary \"kitty cam\" with some spare stuff laying around the house -- security cameras are waaaaaaay too pricey down here.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczMQHsqnqLLO8lardc35DxUywhy1U8FBaYa6D7XqOuySfVG6mgkRkmlPzSdoi2mTiLCXUsFm9w2ihMF6jkfO6dNaDtCDNy2PP0cjhPgT_x0-bZw0MHiRqBUPs7MZMH6pkHYtyLgBmZIuMSSqvZT6NXO8jg=w1788-h1590-s-no-gm?authuser=0\" />\n  <figcaption align=\"center\">T.G.F.W (thank god for WebRTC)</figcaption>\n</p>\n\nWith the school year over as of about a week ago, Grace and I have found ourselves with a bit more free-time than usual.

For now though, when we're not lending a hand prepping charlas or reports in our USF, we escape the heat and lean into our hobbies: Grace has her crochet, books, and kitty time, and I have my Advent of Code, side projects, and occasional ping pong and chess matches with a local (we bought ping pong paddles and a football in Asunci√≥n a few weeks back, both have been a hit).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczOvOpxsd56kTU4EaduXoSdTrLPpdn_JauJu9PcFPyLzdmQRyUc_a0B-4yRO_jCuuH5n7ZAIInOIiGyrcjiivrVPwyAmFpr95URn3cDkSVdIuzVgXu_Rb_kwEdWevLebCn6YOaUdllMPIqPx6N_r3_ypeQ=w2752-h2064-s-no-gm?authuser=0\" />\n  <figcaption align=\"center\"><em>Hake Mate</em></figcaption>\n</p>\n\nI've also recently started Guaran√≠ classes with a local profesor.

I visited a friend that's been here for about a year and a half (more on that in a sec), and he imparted the wisdom that it reaches over 117¬∞F here in January, even in the <em>campo</em> ... so 6d 76 62 79 20 73 6c 61 61 6c 79 20 6c 65 77 73 6c 61 70 63 6c 21 I guess.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"250\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://media.tenor.com/RBrUuN4z0ewAAAAM/guess-ill-die.gif\" />\n  <figcaption align=\"center\"><em>Knowing it's hot, but being too lazy to convert ¬∞C to ¬∞F to know how hot</em></figcaption>\n</p>\n\nIt's been a bit of a slow roll through December since my last blog, but things haven't been totally uneventful. For one, I helped fix a local friend's computer. It was a really old Toshiba Satellite with a hard drive that made a few odd sounds on boot, then proceeded to shut down almost immediately. The computer technician my friend took it to said it would be impossible to fix, so giving it to me was a bit of a hail Mary before it got sent to the dump. I initially figured something funky was up with the arm of the hard drive or the boot record, but before I could investigate much more, the problem resolved itself after a hard reset (holding the power button for 15 seconds, removing the battery, turning back on, etc). I guess turning things off and back on again really <em>is</em> the answer sometimes!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"250\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://media.tenor.com/TkfHDR6TQkEAAAAM/zoolander-zoolander-movie.gif\" />\n   <figcaption align=\"center\"><em>Plan B if the hard reset didn't work (I studied CS not CE)</em></figcaption>\n</p>\n\nMoving along, with the slowness in-site that accompanies the holidays, I decided to visit a buddy's \"nearby\" site to learn a bit about the projects he's been doing in his community for the past year and a half. \"Nearby\" is in quotes because, as the crow flies, his site is pretty close to mine. However, with bus hecticness down here, I ended up having to go all the way to Asunci√≥n, turning a 5ish hour journey to a 24ish hour one. All good -- I got to eat some Mexican food and visit a hobby electronics store while I was in town, so it was totally worth it.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"250\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczOELyPSX5mohsKYTJnWUVVrxFVNWl-FRc6qrQAFaisqUoKmVUk3NCnbZfUP_bMWI9KvxQ8bccoIpl70U8RB7wc1VcB-c87GoAgE_Q9bx2GBQRq5d5hi3t4SQ_9P-hrcp4bFnuCdmJdgHMrpSX3tYX-vcQ=w784-h1188-s-no-gm?authuser=0\" />\n   <figcaption align=\"center\"><em>Awesome food, awesomer shirt?</em></figcaption>\n</p>\n\nMy buddy is an engineer by training and one of the hardest working folks I've ever met. Impressively, he built his own gym from scratch at site! Though I didn't stay at his site long, we spent our time chatting with locals, looking at stars (no light pollution does wonders), grilling up burgers, and making homemade weight plates out of concrete and bicycle rims (he was expanding his gym and I wanted to see how he made his weights). Perhaps the coolest thing of all is that the weight plates were designed jointly by him and one of the community members.

On Christmas Eve, Grace and I went over to our host family's house to enjoy a small asado as the clock struck midnight. I brought my violin to play a little Christmas music (of course!), and the family was thrilled enough with my performance that they invited us along to another house to continue playing. <em>Feliz Navidad</em> was obviously a crowd favorite, but I've been more partial to <em>White Christmas</em> as of late -- nothing like the heat to make you dream of one.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"250\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczPw9EGrrzaqK8MnS_xXGTxAOEkKVIUW8wboKCvlUFPDuy8gCrng6wzmLXWtqrSI9U_VtMVWbR4JxaWCwl_35A3RJXzAf5bmxay7aT0msnpK73BFCFwd2TfGnCZ3q2Uq9aIDL1vXrrcG9ZQ0epL0FTvfMA=w1178-h1278-s-no-gm?authuser=0\" />\n   <figcaption align=\"center\"><em>Stringing together notes, realizing I should learn some Paraguayan songs</em></figcaption>\n</p>\n\nThe tide of a new year inevitably brings in a few waves of reflection (or existentialism, have your pick). It's hard to believe Grace and I left the U.S. 6 months ago. Although it feels like the time has flown by, the missed holidays, life milestones of friend and family, and birthdays are stacking up. However, I'm glad to be where I am. Nestled between the cold sips in <em>terere</em> circles, ad-hoc ping-pong matches with locals, and hot afternoons people-watching at our health post, I've found a little bit of perspective on life, as well as a rekindled love for a few hobbies (I found time to <em>actually</em> complete the advent of code this year! üí™)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"250\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczNceng0-xMdLPbIgbcjNZkORYJRF4kVehq8W6V694EKJVryD7PQfdIduBuVna-oIJ5Af0sqDkiSvj0t2B6OOfP_FA7qYIcPSrbFmOUvtPO7VPaHR2Det487-alrqwesk3Bv6YFeup7V-EAEpIO8qNiTHA=w1152-h1132-s-no-gm?authuser=0\" />\n   <figcaption align=\"center\"><em>Booyah</em></figcaption>\n</p>\n\nCutting the corniness now, as always, here's that sporadic list of things I want to remember and a bonus picture: night shooting pool with GGTL, G leaving, mask lady on <em>caca</em> express, Schrodinger's (locked in) cat, finding Bernie, Jimmy the electronics man, jumping jack E, back with Jif, birthday call. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"250\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczP4yOQuQgwGq9fvxJhsR_Bgyml_aZra9gwqxyBuiVZJPS8uWqsTEUUNZYNPGB9vlGx86OZJ2lXe8i6W8yFRZMwN4r12FvntcM1wKVTy11I_CGSTOup_qOrxBHepbkay1d04hbBwStPt2RgksduH_bxStg=w1200-h1600-s-no-gm?authuser=0\" />\n   <figcaption align=\"center\"><em>Santa?</em></figcaption>\n</p>\n\nFor those wondering what that weird string up top is, I ask: <em>Et tu, Brute?</em>.
